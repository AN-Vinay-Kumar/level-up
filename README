level-up
================================================================================

ABOUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you haven't read the post that inspired this, go do that:

http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/

Now, there's a [gist attached to the article](https://gist.github.com/1133830)
that lets you fork and cross off which ones you've finished, as a sort of
self-tracking tool, but it seems to me that like many things,
*the journey is more important than the destination*.

Hence, this project.

USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * fork
 * enable github pages
